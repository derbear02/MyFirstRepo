Brief Introduction About Myself
I'm an aspiring civil and environmental engineer passionate about using science, storytelling, and community engagement to create lasting change. My journey into sustainability and advocacy is reshaping how I see the world and my role in it. I care deeply about climate justice, education equity, and the power of youth leadership.
Whether through writing, research, or grassroots engagement, I'm exploring how small efforts can lead to meaningful impact. I'm early in my path, but I'm not waiting to make a difference—I'm starting now. I'm eager to learn, take action, and grow alongside others committed to building a better, more sustainable future.S
